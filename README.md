<b>IdenProf</b> is a dataset of identifiable professionals, collected in order to ensure that machine learning systems can be trained
 to recognize professionals by their mode of dressing as humans can observe. This is part of our mission to train machine learning systems to 
  perceive, understand and act accordingly in any environment they are deployed. <br><br>

  This is the first release of the IdenProf dataset. It contains 11,000 images that span cover 10 categories of professions.
